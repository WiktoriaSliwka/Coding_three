I can creating a styled website page that displays a poem. 
Firstly I designed the page on paper to see the general layout. 
I added all the images and text. 
I placed all the images into a div to be able to place them accurately on the screen. 
I changed the fonts and experimented with different ones until I decided on one that I felt fit the style I had in mind. 
I struggled with the sword positioning as in my first draft the images were not within a class. (draft1code.png)
