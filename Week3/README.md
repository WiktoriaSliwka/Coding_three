1. In a paragraph, define what your website is, what it means to you and how it is going to look like.
A website is a virtual storyboard accessible to the public via the internet
My website would be colorful, idk pretty, cool, inspirational 
I dislike modern websites as they are all very minimalistic and i feel that colour, life and creativity is being taken away from too much media in the modern age. I love the look of retro websites and love modern websites that are meant to look retro as they have more functionality but still have the same nostalgic feel to them.


2. Using drawing, Figma, or any other tool, create a rough first draft of your dream website
Id like to create a retro game website. The website will look like an old arcade machine and it will be a shooter game where the user must aim and shoot down targets.The user will move using w,a,s,d keys, aim using their mouse and left click to shoot down the targets. I will look into how to use shadows in CSS so that the game won't be so flat.
