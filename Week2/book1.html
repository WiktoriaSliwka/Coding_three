    <div class="title1"> The Vegetarian by Han Kang </div>
    <div class="blurb1>"> Before the nightmares began, Yeong-hye and her husband lived an ordinary, controlled life.<br>
         But the dreams—invasive images of blood and brutality—torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and<br>
          renounce eating meat altogether. It’s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets <br>
          into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister<br>
           each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that’s become sacred to her. <br>
           Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and <br>
           perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those <br>
           closest to her, but also from herself.

    <div class="review1"> The vegetarian is a short book originally written in korean. I loved the book so much I finished reading
         it in one sitting. It discusses the complexities of the human mind and how a person's mental health affects the people around 
         them. Although the book is not a psychological thriller it kept me on the edge of my seat as I needed to know what was going 
         on in her mind. 
        Yeong-hye is viewed as unremarkable by her husband and peers.She is a victim of her fathers constant physical and mental abuse. 
        One night a nightmares changes the course of her life. She becomes disgusted by the sight of meat and refuses to eat. Rapidly losing 
        weight and hysteria cause her family to be unable to care for her. Everyone has little understanding of her mental condition and 
        she ends up institutionalised.
