    <div class="review2"> A masterpiece of rebellion and imprisonment where war is peace freedom is slavery and Big Brother is watching. 
        Thought Police, Big Brother, Orwellian - these words have entered our vocabulary because of George Orwell's classic dystopian novel 
        1984. The story of one man's Nightmare Odyssey as he pursues a forbidden love affair through a world ruled by warring states and a
         power structure that controls not only information but also individual thought and memory 1984 is a prophetic haunting tale More
          relevant than ever before 1984 exposes the worst crimes imaginable the destruction of truth freedom and individuality </div>
