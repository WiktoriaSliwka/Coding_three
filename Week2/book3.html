        brief time they spent playing together as children. Their unique spark is instantly reignited. What comes next is a story of<br>
        friendship and rivalry, fame and creativity, betrayal and tragedy, perfect worlds and imperfect ones. And, ultimately, our need to <br>
        connect: to be loved and to love.

    <div class="review3">This book became an unlikely favourite of mine. I found this book very inspiring as someone who also studies 
        computing and enjoys video games. It's a story of computer science students with a love of gaming who create a video game together
        and then decide to make more after the games original success. I found the story took some very real turns that many people experience. 
        This is a fiction book and may not be as historically important and impactful as the other books on my bookshelf but it was still an 
        interesting read.
