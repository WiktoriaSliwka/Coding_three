I'm creating a bookshelf that displays my current 5 favorite books(1984,Animal Farm, Butter, Tomorrow Tomorrow, Tomorrow, The Vegetarian). 

The landing page will be a bookshelf with the spin showing the book title. The Website user can click on which book they are interested in and then take the user to the correct website page. 
Displayed on each page there will be a blurb, my personal review and cover image. I will aim to design each book page in the style of the story which will allow me to experiment with different styles.

I firstly created the bookshelf and books and ensured each hyper-link functioned as intended. I created a basic webpage for each book containing the blurb, review and cover image. Next I focused on positioning by creating each page into a container allowing me to move the page contents freely. I placed the cover image on the left hand side and the blurb and review in the middle of the screen. The title is placed on top and spans the whole screen.

Once the webpages are layed out correctly I focused on designing each page making it look more attractive. 
Firstly I added fonts to match each book, added a border to each cover image and changed the background color. 
I then decided to add navigation buttons sp the user can go back and forth between pages.
On some pages the buttons were not directly below the text but on the side as it has to be placed outside the container class.

I decided to create backgrounds using css. Firstly I added an ascii art background to book 3 which i found online. I pasted in in and changed the color and size to fit the screen and match the font. (https://emojicombos.com/wave-ascii-art)

I decided to create a floral backgrounds using for book 1. For this I followed a youtube tutorial 
A repetitive brutalist pattern for book 2 and 4. 
for book five i decided to create an animation 
lastly i added a vase and flower pot to the landing page to make it look more attractive.
